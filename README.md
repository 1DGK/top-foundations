# top-foundations
This is a project from the flexbox foundations section of The Odin Project.

TIPS:
Google constantly, but don't peek at other submissions.

Get it close but not perfect.

Do your own thing with content.

For images, use free-to-use places like Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash. Give credit by putting creator's name and contact info in the README file. 

Commit early and often.

Font in the images is roboto.

Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

"Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website youâ€™re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan."

"...do the HTML and then do the CSS."
